Question 1
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: 
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

Solution:
l=[]
for i in range(2000, 3201):
    if (i%7==0) and (i%5!=0):
        l.append(str(i))

print ','.join(l)

Question 2
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
def fact(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    return x * fact(x - 1)

x=int(raw_input())
print fact(x)

Question 6
Level 2

Question:
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
Example
Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180
The output of the program should be:
18,22,24

Hints:
If the output received is in decimal form, it should be rounded off to its nearest value (for example, if the output received is 26.0, it should be printed as 26)
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input. 

Solution:
#!/usr/bin/env python
import math
c=50
h=30
value = []
items=[x for x in raw_input().split(',')]
for d in items:
    value.append(str(int(round(math.sqrt(2*c*float(d)/h)))))

print ','.join(value)
